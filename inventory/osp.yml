## YAML based inventory, see:
## https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory/yaml.html
#
# Example using mix of distros
# Overriding some defaults at hostgroup and individual guest levels
# Note that the virt_infra_variant are not set to specific versions,
# this is to make it work on different hosts
# Note also that CentOS 8 needs the path to system Python
example:
  hosts:
    osp:
      virt_infra_state: running
      virt_infra_host_image_path: "/var/lib/libvirt/images"
      virt_infra_variant: rhel8.2
      virt_infra_distro_image: rhel-8.2-x86_64-kvm.qcow2
      virt_infra_timezone: "UTC"
      virt_infra_ram: 16000
      virt_infra_cpus: 8
      virt_infra_disks:
        - name: "boot"
          size: "40"
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/libexec/platform-python
      #virt_infra_disk_cmd:
      #  - 'somecommand'
      virt_infra_networks:
        - name: "osp"
        - name: "osp2"
